## features:
#### programs
- programs for access the vehicle over the internet 
  - program for controlling motors
  - program for videostreaming
- open-source software, all programs written in python
(not secure but easy to understand)
- programs using udp for low latency
- opencv for taking video and displaying them, good for future AI 
- all programs can as well be used for standard rc-cars, airplanes or boats <br /> with PWM input and even for stationary surveillance cameras.

#### 3d printing
- open-source hardware, hole car 3D-printable
  - 3D-printed ball bearing (printable in one piece without any support)
  - 3D-printed flexible tires (airless, filaflex 82A)
- insertable metal springs on all axis
- assembly with only M3-screws and threaded brass inserts
- support structures rarely required, low part count, easy assemply

#### electronics
- two individual servomotors to steer the front wheels
- two individual brushless motors directly integrated into the rear wheels 
  (inwheel, hubmotor)
- raspberry pi
- blheli32 ESC's
- 18650 cells with bms (25.2V)
- low cost
- 
#### disadvantages
- low torque cause of directdrive hub motor and  sensorless ESC
 (will increase with planetary gear and currentsensing ESC)
